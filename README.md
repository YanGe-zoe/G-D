**Aims**  
1、To address the limitation of existing pump-driven droplet microfluidic technologies, which are unable to generate microdroplets at relatively low speeds.
2、 To overcome the inability of current droplet microfluidic systems to generate a single microdroplet at a specific moment on demand.

**Methods**  
A gravity-driven droplet microfluidic system, controlled by a three-way valve, is designed to generate single droplets on demand. The system mainly consists of three modules:
(1) an oil/water two-phase liquid-level control module,
(2) a three-way valve switching control module, and
(3) an integrated control system.

As shown in [Figure](images/Schematic%20of%20the%20Gravity-Driven%20Single-Droplet%20Generator.png)，
the liquid-level control module includes one unit for regulating the height of the aqueous phase and two units for controlling the height of the oil phase. Among them, the oil/water liquid-level control module (1) and the three-way valve switching control module (2) are the key components that enable the generation of a single droplet at a specific moment.

By repeatedly switching the three-way valve, stable droplet generation can be achieved at a maximum frequency of 1 droplet per second. When combined with optical tweezer technology, this system allows individual cells to be encapsulated within single droplets, enabling precise manipulation at the single-cell level.
